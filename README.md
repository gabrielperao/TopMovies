# TOP MOVIES

This project was developed during an internship application for Tokenlab. It consists on a mobile app that consumes the TMDb API and displays information about the top 20 highest-rated movies.
<br><br>
🚀 To access the main code, go to [app/src/main/java/com/example/topmovies](https://www.github.com/gabrielperao/TopMovies/tree/main/app/src/main/java/com/example/topmovies)
<br><br>
## Functionalities
🎥 The main window displays the poster and title of the top 20 highest-rated movies, according to The Movie Database's rank.
<br><br>

<br><br>
ℹ️ The user can click on any movie poster to open a second window. There they'll be able to see more details about the film, such as release year, spoken languages, movie rating and its overview.

🚫 This app also has exception treatments, and the user will be notified if the movies' data can't be downloaded (or in case of any other issue).<br>
